## Idea

1. Clone git repo.
2. Search for all files based on a list of file extensions (python only for now).
3. Read each file and extract a list of all functions and variables outside of functions.
4. For each function, generate a short description using a code-trained model from huggingface.
5. For each class, generate a short description using a code-trained model from huggingface.
6. Tokenize and store in Vector Database.
7. ???
